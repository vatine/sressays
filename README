This is a collection of... essays is probably the least inappropriate
word, on things that pertain to running computer systems in
production. They may touch on monitoring, design, philosophy. As a
general rule, they're not endorsed by anyone but the author and
specifically are not endorsed by any specific workplace.

Comments, corrections, and similar can be raised as issues.
