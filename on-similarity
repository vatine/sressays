When dealing with configuration, it is often the case that things are
similar. It is of utmost importance, when you see two things that are
identical, to find out if they are accidentally identical, or
intentionally identical.

If they are intentionally identical, it is good to capture this
similarity in an "is-a" type of container (a class, a template, ...),
so the intentional indenticality can them be expressed as a has-a /
is-a / inherits type of relationship.

If they are merely accidentally identical (that is, they happen to
look alike, rather than actually needing to do so) it is of imperative
importance to NOT capture this similarity in a joined piece of
configuation, but instead list the identical peices separately.

If you do not follow this rule, your intentionally-identical things
will drift and your accidentally-identical things will have surprise
changes when the accidental similarity is no longer similar.
